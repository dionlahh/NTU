With Logan working across the country and only seeing his wife Penny on rare occasions, the two keep things exciting by delving into the world of hot-wifing. Penny, eager to please her husband, satiates his desires by bedding a variety of different men. Logan's situation did not begin that way--his first marriage to Melissa fell apart after they explored hot-wifing. Luckily his therapist, Luna, has helped him evolve and embrace wife-sharing with a healthy approach. With a solid marriage and an intensely satisfying sex life, Penny shares her secret to marital bliss with her friend Ryan. But his skepticism further proves that not everyone has what it takes to enjoy sharing...however, when they do it is certain to be a powerful test of both love and lust.",0.854,/wh35TME232bmio6old66mbVz2q2.jpg,"[{'id': 6671, 'logo_path': '/6im4djIvfI8aLD1hVsZTQ2Fi4uL.png', 'name': 'Sweet Sinner', 'origin_country': 'CA'}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'CA', 'name': 'Canada'}]",2017-12-13,0,147.0,"[{'english_name': 'English', 'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,A Good Wife Must Be Shared,The Hot Wives,False,0.0,0,,,,

The compelling narrative is richly enhanced by its subtexts: the lone outsider versus the conformist mob; the dreamer of improbable dreams that lead to tragedy; the artist (dreamer) versus the Philistines, and the homosexual overtones of Grimes' abuse of his child apprentices. Britten is conductor of his work and tenor Peter Pears is Grimes, 25 years after he created the title role at the opera's premiere. As the widow Ellen Orford, soprano Heather Harper is magnificent.

Roses is not who she makes out to be; she is a vicious and evil lady who makes life hell for her Client. Neal goes through a cruel and awful ordeal that he never thought he would have to go through, especially after his brutal shark attack. Neal is sharing the home with another Client called Tim who helps Neal. They work together and finally manage to call for help. Finally, Roses is put away where she belongs. Weeks pass and Neal answers the door to a Lady named Rosie. This is a two part movie. The sequel to ""King of the Ocean"" is available on another DVD titled ""Rosie's Return.""
